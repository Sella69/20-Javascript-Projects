This project mainly concerns:

Dom manipulation:
UI elements are styled dynamically by using CSS classes in conjunction with Javascript.

LocalStorage:
The users selections are saved into local storage making use of methods such as JSON.stringify, so that the user data is maintained even after the browser reloeads. The data is then retreived and used to update the DOM using methods such as JSON.parse().

Project Specifications:

-Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend &  seat info
-User can select a movie/price
-User can select/deselect seats
-User can not select occupied seats
-Number of seats and price will update
-Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh
